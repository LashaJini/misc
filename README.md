# Misc

## TODO

- [x] [Dark Mode]
- [ ] [Indicator for active tab]
- [x] [Drawer when in projects tab]
- [ ] [any project]
- [ ] [pallette]
- [ ] [remove tooltip when accessing drawer/menu]

## FIX

- [ ] [from Landscape -> Portrait, while Settings menu is open, does not get resized]
- [ ] [forwardRef warning, I think it's happening in Stats.tsx]
- [ ] [some render warning when going from undefine to defined value, in particle width/height]
- [x] [tooltip does not work on Settings menu] - fixed by wrapping inside Box
